# Demand Forecasting:

Demand forecasting is the process of predicting future sales by using historical sales data to make informed business decisions about everything from inventory planning to running flash sales. Demand forecasting helps estimate the total sales and revenue for a future period of time. Itâ€™s important to be able to forecast customer demand so that you can prepare a budget, stock inventory, allocate resources, and update pricing strategy.

**Advantages of Demand Forecasting** :
- Gaining insight is a must for operations that are seeking to generate adequate forecasts. Forecasting gets you into the habit of looking at the past and real-time data to predict future demand.
- Forecasting also enables you to make decisions based off of past errors and could provide insight on how to correct these in the future.
- Anticipating demand will aid you with tweaking your processes to increase efficiency all along the supply chain.
